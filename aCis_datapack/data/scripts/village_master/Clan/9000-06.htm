<html><body><font color="LEVEL">[Clan Leader Delegation Request]</font><br>
One of the clan members can be selected and be delegated the role of clan leader.<br>
Please consider your decision carefully before making the request.<br>
I'll say this once more. Since the delegation of a clan lord is the process in which all the rights of a clan leader are transferred to another clan member, you need to consider your decision very carefully before submitting your request.<br>
